		After 2nd Period, Chance and I walked to Ms. Sinclair’s to leave our backpacks there until we were back from the trip. Then we walked back to the main lobby to wait for our bus to get here. We formed our little groups and talked until our bus got here. Ms. Sinclair told us to wait so that she could check roll while we got on. Takori, Noah, Caleb, Chance, Fuya, and me went to the back.

		We talked and listened to our music for life half the way there. Then someone said we should for a group chat so that we could play some uno. Then we got bored of uno so we all played some 8-ball and cup pong. When we arrived downtown and passed the Bass Pro some of us took pictures of it to put it on our snapchat stories. We got to our stop and we all got off and started walking towards Archer Malmo. We walked inside to the lobby of the building and waited for our elevator to get down.

		We got on the elevator in like groups of 6 up to like the 4th floor. When I got up there people were playing Ping Pong. We were loud so some guy walked out and said they were in a meeting and told us to be quieter. Then Ms. Sinclair and the speaker got up and he started talking and showing some presentation. I tried to get a chair but I was too late. I had to stand against some pillar. He talked about some of their past projects and showed us a couple. I looked around and about everyone was asleep. About halfway through my legs started to get tired. Luckily I got through it and Ms. Sinclair told us to take pictures for our project. We took the stairs up to their main floor to look around, then they took us to their recording room, where they had green screens and all sorts of stuff. We took the stairs up to the main lobby again and waited for everyone else to get there. Then we walked back down the street to get on the bus. It wasn’t there so we had to wait for it again.

		We got on the bus, this time in the front so that we could get off first and order. Nothing really happened we just looked around and listened to music. When we got there we got off and walked inside. I was like third in line so I ordered and then waited for my food. When they called my number I went up there to get my food and sat down next to Caleb, Chance and Takori. We ate our food and talked for a bit. Then when it was time to go we threw away our trash and made our way to the bus. This time we sat in the back of the bus. On our way back to school, we all were talking about how we hope that the bus broke down so that we wouldn’t have to go back to 7th Period. We got back to school, and Chance, Caleb and me walked back slowly to get our backpacks. Then we went back to 7th Period to finish the school day.
